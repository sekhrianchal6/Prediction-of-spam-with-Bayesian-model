# Prediction-of-spam-with-Bayesian-model


#For a binary spam classification task with 9 pre-scaled features, I employed classical models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest), Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, and Naive Bayes. Data preprocessing included handling missing values and outliers. ROC-AUC was used for evaluation, and feature engineering was suggested for enhanced performance.
